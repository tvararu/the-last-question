    <p>Isaac Asimov was the most prolific science fiction author of all time.</p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">In fifty years he averaged a new magazine article<span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">, short story</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, or book </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">every two weeks, and most of that on a manual typewriter.</span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">Asimov thought that The Last Question, first copyrighted in 1956, was his best short story ever.</p>

    <p>To quote the author:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>This is by far my favorite story of all those I have written.</em></p>
      <p data-jmpress="fade-fast"><em>After all, I undertook to tell several trillion years of human history in the space of a short story and I leave it to you as to how well I succeeded. I also undertook another task, but I won't tell you what that was lest l spoil the story for you.</em></p>
      <p data-jmpress="fade-fast"><em>It is a curious fact that innumerable readers have asked me if I wrote this story. They seem never to remember the title of the story or (for sure) the author, except for the vague thought it might be me. But, of course, they never forget the story itself especially the ending. The idea seems to drown out everything -- and I'm satisfied that it should.</em></p>

    <h1>The<br/>Last<br/>Question</h1>
    <h3>Isaac Asimov</h3>
  </section>
  <section id="the-first-time">
    <p>

      The last question was asked for the first time<span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms step">, half in jest</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, on May 21, 2061, </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">at a time when humanity first stepped into the light. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">The question came about as a result of a five-dollar bet over highballs, and it happened this way:</span>
    </p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast"><span class="p1">Alexander Adell </span>and <span class="p2">Bertram Lupov </span>were two of the faithful attendants of Multivac. <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">As well as any human beings could, they knew what lay behind the </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">cold, </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">clicking, </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">flashing face </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">-- miles and miles of face -- of that giant computer. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">They had at least a vague notion of the general plan of relays and circuits that had long since grown past the point where any single human could possibly have a firm grasp of the whole.</span></p>
  </section>
  <section id="multivac">
    <p>

      Multivac was self-adjusting and self-correcting. <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">It had to be, </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">for nothing human could adjust and correct it quickly enough or even adequately enough. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">So Adell and Lupov attended the monstrous giant only lightly and superficially, </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1500ms prev">yet as well as any men could. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">They fed it data, </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">adjusted questions to its needs </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">and translated the answers that were issued. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">Certainly they, and all others like them, were fully entitled to share in the glory that was Multivac's.</span>
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="decades">
    <p>For decades, Multivac had helped design the ships and plot the trajectories that enabled man to reach <span id="moon" data-jmpress="fade-fast" class="planets">the Moon<img src="img/moon.png"/></span><span id="mars" data-jmpress="fade-fast" class="planets">, Mars<img src="img/mars.png"/></span><span id="venus" data-jmpress="fade-fast" class="planets">

        , and Venus<img src="img/venus.png"/></span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">, but past that, </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">Earth's poor resources could not support the ships. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">Too much energy was needed for the long trips. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">Earth exploited its coal and uranium with increasing efficiency</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, but there was only so much of both.</span></p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>

      But slowly Multivac learned enough to answer deeper questions more fundamentally, and on May 14, 2061, what had been theory, became fact.
    </p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">

      The energy of the sun was stored<span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, converted</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, and utilized </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">directly on a planet-wide scale. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">All Earth turned off its burning coal</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, its fissioning uranium</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">, and flipped the switch that connected all of it to a small station, one mile in diameter, circling the Earth at half the distance of the Moon. </span>
    </p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">All Earth ran by invisible beams of sunpower.</p>

  <section>
    <p>Seven days had not sufficed to dim the glory of it and <span class="p1">Adell </span>and <span class="p2">Lupov </span>finally managed to escape from the public functions, and to meet in quiet where no one would think of looking for them, in the deserted underground chambers, where portions of the mighty buried body of Multivac showed. <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">Unattended</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, idling</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, sorting data with contented lazy clickings</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, Multivac, too, had earned its vacation and the boys appreciated that.</span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">

        They had no intention<span data-jmpress="fade after 1500ms prev">, originally, </span>of disturbing it.</span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">They had brought a bottle with them<span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">, and their only concern at the moment was to relax in the company of each other and the bottle.</span></p>

    <p><span class="p1">Adell </span>was just drunk enough to try, just sober enough to be able to phrase the necessary symbols and operations into a question which, in words, might have corresponded to this: <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">Will mankind one day without the net expenditure of energy be able to restore the sun to its full youthfulness <span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">even after it had died of old age?</span></span></p>

    <p>Then, just as the frightened technicians felt they could hold their breath no longer, there was a sudden springing to life of the teletype attached to that portion of Multivac. Five words were printed: </p>

    <p>It was a nice feeling to have a Microvac of your own and <span class="p3">Jerrodd </span>was glad he was part of his generation and no other. <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">In his father's youth, the only computers had been tremendous machines taking up a hundred square miles of land. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">There was only one to a planet. </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">Planetary ACs they were called. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">They had been growing in size steadily for a thousand years and then<span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">, all at once</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, came refinement. </span></span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">In place of transistors, had come molecular valves so that even the largest Planetary AC could be put into a space only half the volume of a spaceship.</span></p>
