The Last Question
===

Back in early 2013, [The Last Question](http://filer.case.edu/dts8/thelastq.htm) inevitably resurfaced back to the top of Hacker News and I got to read it for the first time. I was so impressed by the short story that I went out and built this in roughly two to three days. It's a weird book/app hybrid which I feel does a better job of presenting the book than a plain HTML page.

Not thoroughly tested on multiple devices, browsers or screen sizes, so YMMV. Try Chrome or Webkit. And enjoy the read.

All rights to the book are reserved by the Asimov Foundation.
