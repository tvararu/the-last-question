    <p>Isaac Asimov was the most prolific science fiction author of all time.</p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">In fifty years he averaged a new magazine article<span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">, short story</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, or book </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">every two weeks, and most of that on a manual typewriter.</span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">Asimov thought that The Last Question, first copyrighted in 1956, was his best short story ever.</p>

    <p>To quote the author:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>This is by far my favorite story of all those I have written.</em></p>
      <p data-jmpress="fade-fast"><em>After all, I undertook to tell several trillion years of human history in the space of a short story and I leave it to you as to how well I succeeded. I also undertook another task, but I won't tell you what that was lest l spoil the story for you.</em></p>
      <p data-jmpress="fade-fast"><em>It is a curious fact that innumerable readers have asked me if I wrote this story. They seem never to remember the title of the story or (for sure) the author, except for the vague thought it might be me. But, of course, they never forget the story itself especially the ending. The idea seems to drown out everything -- and I'm satisfied that it should.</em></p>

    <h3>Isaac Asimov</h3>
  </section>
  <section id="the-first-time">
    <p>
       
      The last question was asked for the first time<span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms step">, half in jest</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, on May 21, 2061, </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">at a time when humanity first stepped into the light. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">The question came about as a result of a five-dollar bet over highballs, and it happened this way:</span>
    </p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">Alexander Adell and Bertram Lupov were two of the faithful attendants of Multivac. <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">As well as any human beings could, they knew what lay behind the </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">cold, </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">clicking, </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">flashing face </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">-- miles and miles of face -- of that giant computer. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">They had at least a vague notion of the general plan of relays and circuits that had long since grown past the point where any single human could possibly have a firm grasp of the whole.</span></p>
  </section>
  <section id="multivac">
    <p>
       
      Multivac was self-adjusting and self-correcting. <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">It had to be, </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">for nothing human could adjust and correct it quickly enough or even adequately enough. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">So Adell and Lupov attended the monstrous giant only lightly and superficially, </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1500ms prev">yet as well as any men could. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">They fed it data, </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">adjusted questions to its needs </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">and translated the answers that were issued. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">Certainly they, and all others like them, were fully entitled to share in the glory that was Multivac's.</span>
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="decades">
    <p>For decades, Multivac had helped design the ships and plot the trajectories that enabled man to reach <span id="moon" data-jmpress="fade-fast" class="planets">the Moon<img src="img/moon.png"/></span><span id="mars" data-jmpress="fade-fast" class="planets">, Mars<img src="img/mars.png"/></span><span id="venus" data-jmpress="fade-fast" class="planets">
         
        , and Venus<img src="img/venus.png"/></span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">, but past that, </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">Earth's poor resources could not support the ships. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">Too much energy was needed for the long trips. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">Earth exploited its coal and uranium with increasing efficiency</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, but there was only so much of both.</span></p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>
       
      But slowly Multivac learned enough to answer deeper questions more fundamentally, and on May 14, 2061, what had been theory, became fact.
    </p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">
       
      The energy of the sun was stored<span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, converted</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, and utilized </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">directly on a planet-wide scale. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">All Earth turned off its burning coal</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, its fissioning uranium</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">, and flipped the switch that connected all of it to a small station, one mile in diameter, circling the Earth at half the distance of the Moon. </span>
    </p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">All Earth ran by invisible beams of sunpower.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Seven days had not sufficed to dim the glory of it and Adell and Lupov finally managed to escape from the public functions, and to meet in quiet where no one would think of looking for them, in the deserted underground chambers, where portions of the mighty buried body of Multivac showed. <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">Unattended</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, idling</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, sorting data with contented lazy clickings</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, Multivac, too, had earned its vacation and the boys appreciated that.</span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">
         
        They had no intention<span data-jmpress="fade after 1500ms prev">, originally, </span>of disturbing it.</span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">They had brought a bottle with them<span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">, and their only concern at the moment was to relax in the company of each other and the bottle.</span></p>

  <section>
    <p>"It's amazing when you think of it," <span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms step">said Adell. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">His broad face had lines of weariness in it</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">, and he stirred his drink slowly with a glass rod</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev" class="ice">, watching the cubes of ice slur <span class="clumsy">clumsily</span> about. </span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">
       
      "All the energy we can possibly ever use for free. <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">Enough energy, if we wanted to draw on it</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">, to melt all Earth into a big drop of impure liquid iron</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">, and still never miss the energy so used. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">All the energy we could ever use</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">, forever </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">and forever </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">and forever."</span>

    <p>Lupov cocked his head <span class="sideways">sideways</span>. <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">He had a trick of doing that when he wanted to be contrary</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">, and he wanted to be contrary now</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">, partly because he had had to carry the ice and glassware. </span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"Not forever," he said.</p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"Oh, hell, just about forever. <span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">Till the sun runs down, Bert."</span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"That's not forever."</p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"All right, then. <span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">Billions and billions of years. </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">Ten billion, maybe. </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">Are you satisfied?"</span></p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Lupov put his fingers through his <span class="thinning">thinning hair </span>as though to reassure himself that some was still left and sipped gently at his own drink. "Ten billion years isn't forever."</p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"Well, it will last our time, won't it?"</p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"So would the coal and uranium."</p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"All right<span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, but now we can hook up each individual spaceship to the Solar Station</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">, and it can go to Pluto and back a million times without ever worrying about fuel. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">You can't do that on coal and uranium. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">Ask Multivac<span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, if you don't believe me."</span></span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">
       
      "I don't have to ask Multivac. <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">I know that."</span>
    </p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"Then stop running down what Multivac's done for us," said Adell, blazing up, "It did all right."</p>

      "Who says it didn't? What I say is that a sun won't last forever. <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">That's all I'm saying. <span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev" class="safe">We're safe for ten billion years, but then what?" Lupov pointed a slightly <span class="shaky">shaky</span> finger at the other. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">"And don't say we'll switch to another sun."</span></span>
    </p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">There was silence for a while.
      <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">Adell put his glass to his lips only occasionally<span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">, and Lupov's eyes slowly closed. </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">They rested.</span></p>

    <p>
       
      Then Lupov's eyes <span class="snapped">snapped open</span>. 
      <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"You're thinking we'll switch to another sun when ours is done<span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">, aren't you?"</span></p>
    </p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"I'm not thinking."</p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"Sure you are. <span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">You're weak on logic</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, that's the trouble with you. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">You're like the guy in the story who was caught in a sudden shower and who ran to a grove of trees and got under one. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">He wasn't worried<span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, you see</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, because he figured when one tree got wet through</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">, he would just get under another one."</span></span></p>

      "I get it," said Adell. <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">"Don't shout. <span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">When the sun is done</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, the other stars will be gone, too."</span></span>
    </p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"Darn right they will," muttered Lupov. <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">
         
        "It all had a beginning in the original cosmic explosion<span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, whatever that was</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, and it'll all have an end when all the stars run down. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">Some run down faster than others. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">Hell</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, the giants won't last a hundred million years. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">The sun will last ten billion years </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">and maybe the dwarfs will last two hundred billion for all the good they are. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">But just give us a trillion years and <span class="dark">everything will be dark</span>. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">Entropy has to increase to maximum, that's all."</span></span></p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>"I know all about entropy," <span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms step">said Adell</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, standing on his dignity.</span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"The hell you do."</p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"I know as much as you do."</p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"Then you know everything's got to run down someday."</p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"All right.<span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev"> Who says they won't?"</span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"You did<span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, you poor sap. </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">You said we had all the energy we needed</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, forever. </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">You said 'forever.'</span></p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>It was Adell's turn to be contrary. <span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms step">"Maybe we can build things up again someday," </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">he said.</span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"Never."</p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"Why not? Someday."</p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"Never."</p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"Ask Multivac."</p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"You ask Multivac. <span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">I dare you. </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">Five dollars says it can't be done."</span></p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Adell was just drunk enough to try, just sober enough to be able to phrase the necessary symbols and operations into a question which, in words, might have corresponded to this: <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">Will mankind one day without the net expenditure of energy be able to restore the sun to its full youthfulness <span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">even after it had died of old age?</span></span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">Or maybe it could be put more simply like this: <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">How can the net amount of entropy of the universe be massively decreased?</span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">Multivac fell dead and silent. <span data-jmpress="fade-slow">The slow flashing of lights ceased, </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">the distant sounds of clicking relays ended.</span></p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Then, just as the frightened technicians felt they could hold their breath no longer, there was a sudden springing to life of the teletype attached to that portion of Multivac. Five words were printed: </p>

    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"No bet," whispered Lupov. <span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">They left hurriedly.</span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">By next morning<span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, the two</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, plagued with throbbing head and cottony mouth</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">, had forgotten the incident.</span></p>

    <p>At once, the even powdering of stars gave way to the predominance of a single bright shining disk<span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms step">, the size of a marble</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, centered on the viewing-screen.</span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"That's X-23," said Jerrodd confidently. <span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">His thin hands clamped tightly behind his back and the knuckles whitened.</span></p>

  <section>
    <p>The little Jerrodettes<span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms step">, both girls</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, had experienced the hyperspace passage for the first time in their lives and were self-conscious over the momentary sensation of insideoutness. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">They buried their giggles <span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">and chased one another wildly about their mother</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, screaming, "We've reached X-23 -- we've reached X-23 -- we've --"</span></span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"Quiet, children." said Jerrodine sharply. <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">"Are you sure, Jerrodd?"</span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"What is there to be but sure?" asked Jerrodd, glancing up at the bulge of featureless metal just under the ceiling. <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">
         
        It ran the length of the room, <span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">disappearing through the wall at either end. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">It was as long as the ship.</span></span></p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Jerrodd scarcely knew a thing about the thick rod of metal except that it was called a Microvac, that one asked it questions if one wished<span data-jmpress="fade-fast">; that if one did not it still had its task of guiding the ship to a preordered destination</span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">; of feeding on energies from the various Sub-galactic Power Stations</span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">; of computing the equations for the hyperspatial jumps.</span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">Jerrodd and his family had only to wait and live in the comfortable residence quarters of the ship. <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">Someone had once told Jerrodd that the "ac" at the end of "Microvac" stood for ''automatic computer" in ancient English</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">, but he was on the edge of forgetting even that.</span></p>
  </section>

    <p>Jerrodine's eyes were moist as she watched the visiplate. <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">"I can't help it. </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">I feel funny about leaving Earth."</span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"Why, for Pete's sake?" demanded Jerrodd. <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">"We had nothing there. </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">We'll have everything on X-23. </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">You won't be alone. </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">You won't be a pioneer. </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">There are over a million people on the planet already. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">Good Lord, our great-grandchildren will be looking for new worlds because X-23 will be overcrowded." </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">Then, after a reflective pause</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">, "I tell you, it's a lucky thing the computers worked out interstellar travel the way the race is growing."</span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"I know, I know," said Jerrodine miserably.</p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">Jerrodette I said promptly<span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, "Our Microvac is the best Microvac in the world."</span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"I think so, too," said Jerrodd, tousling her hair.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>It was a nice feeling to have a Microvac of your own and Jerrodd was glad he was part of his generation and no other. <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">In his father's youth, the only computers had been tremendous machines taking up a hundred square miles of land. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">There was only one to a planet. </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">Planetary ACs they were called. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">They had been growing in size steadily for a thousand years and then<span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">, all at once</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, came refinement. </span></span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">In place of transistors, had come molecular valves so that even the largest Planetary AC could be put into a space only half the volume of a spaceship.</span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">Jerrodd felt uplifted<span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, as he always did when he thought that his own personal Microvac was many times more complicated than the ancient and primitive Multivac that had first tamed the Sun</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev">, and almost as complicated as Earth's Planetarv AC (the largest) that had first solved the problem of hyperspatial travel and had made trips to the stars possible.</span></p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>"So many stars, so many planets," sighed Jerrodine, busy with her own thoughts. <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">"I suppose families will be going out to new planets forever</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, the way we are now."</span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"Not forever," said Jerrodd, with a smile. <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">"It will all stop someday<span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, but not for billions of years. </span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">Many billions. </span></span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">Even the stars run down, you know. </span><span data-jmpress="fade-fast">Entropy must increase."</span></p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">"What's entropy, daddy?" shrilled Jerrodette II.</p>
    <p data-jmpress="fade-fast">
       
      "Entropy, little sweet, is just a word which means the amount of running-down of the universe. <span data-jmpress="fade-fast">Everything runs down<span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, you know</span><span data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev">, like your little walkie-talkie robot, remember?"</span></span>
