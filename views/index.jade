    p Isaac Asimov was the most prolific science fiction author of all time.
    p(data-jmpress="fade-fast")
      | In fifty years he averaged a new magazine article
      span(data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev") , short story
      span(data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev") , or book 
      span(data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev") every two weeks, and most of that on a manual typewriter.
    p(data-jmpress="fade-fast") Asimov thought that The Last Question, first copyrighted in 1956, was his best short story ever.

      p
        em This is by far my favorite story of all those I have written.
      p(data-jmpress="fade-fast")
        em After all, I undertook to tell several trillion years of human history in the space of a short story and I leave it to you as to how well I succeeded. I also undertook another task, but I won't tell you what that was lest l spoil the story for you.
      p(data-jmpress="fade-fast")
        em It is a curious fact that innumerable readers have asked me if I wrote this story. They seem never to remember the title of the story or (for sure) the author, except for the vague thought it might be me. But, of course, they never forget the story itself especially the ending. The idea seems to drown out everything -- and I'm satisfied that it should.

  //- section 1
  section#the-first-time
    p 
      | The last question was asked for the first time
      span(data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms step"), half in jest
      span(data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev"), on May 21, 2061, 
      span(data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev") at a time when humanity first stepped into the light. 
      span(data-jmpress="fade-fast") The question came about as a result of a five-dollar bet over highballs, and it happened this way:
    p(data-jmpress="fade-fast")
      | Alexander Adell and Bertram Lupov were two of the faithful attendants of Multivac. 
      span(data-jmpress="fade-fast") As well as any human beings could, they knew what lay behind the 
      span(data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev") cold, 
      span(data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev") clicking, 
      span(data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev") flashing face 
      span(data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev") -- miles and miles of face -- of that giant computer. 
      span(data-jmpress="fade-fast") They had at least a vague notion of the general plan of relays and circuits that had long since grown past the point where any single human could possibly have a firm grasp of the whole.
  
  section#multivac
    p 
      | Multivac was self-adjusting and self-correcting. 
      span(data-jmpress="fade-fast") It had to be, 
      span(data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev") for nothing human could adjust and correct it quickly enough or even adequately enough. 
      span(data-jmpress="fade-fast") So Adell and Lupov attended the monstrous giant only lightly and superficially, 
      span(data-jmpress="fade after 1500ms prev") yet as well as any men could. 
      span(data-jmpress="fade-fast") They fed it data, 
      span(data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev") adjusted questions to its needs 
      span(data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev") and translated the answers that were issued. 
      span(data-jmpress="fade-fast") Certainly they, and all others like them, were fully entitled to share in the glory that was Multivac's.
  
  section#decades
    p
      | For decades, Multivac had helped design the ships and plot the trajectories that enabled man to reach

        img(src="img/venus.png")
      span(data-jmpress="fade-fast") , but past that, 
      span(data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev") Earth's poor resources could not support the ships. 
      span(data-jmpress="fade-fast") Too much energy was needed for the long trips. 
      span(data-jmpress="fade-fast") Earth exploited its coal and uranium with increasing efficiency
      span(data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev") , but there was only so much of both.
  
  section
    p 
      | But slowly Multivac learned enough to answer deeper questions more fundamentally, and on May 14, 2061, what had been theory, became fact.
    p(data-jmpress="fade-fast") 
      | The energy of the sun was stored
      span(data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev") , converted
      span(data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev") , and utilized 
      span(data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev") directly on a planet-wide scale. 
      span(data-jmpress="fade-fast") All Earth turned off its burning coal
      span(data-jmpress="fade after 500ms prev") , its fissioning uranium
      span(data-jmpress="fade after 1000ms prev") , and flipped the switch that connected all of it to a small station, one mile in diameter, circling the Earth at half the distance of the Moon. 
    p(data-jmpress="fade-fast") All Earth ran by invisible beams of sunpower.

    p
      | Seven days had not sufficed to dim the glory of it and Adell and Lupov finally managed to escape from the public functions, and to meet in quiet where no one would think of looking for them, in the deserted underground chambers, where portions of the mighty buried body of Multivac showed.
